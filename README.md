## Features

- Participate in chat rooms made by anyone
- Create personal account to participate in chat rooms
- Create own chat room with custom title / topic

## Description

We wanted to create a simple chat room that anyone could participate in. Even without logging in, you can view what chat rooms are available and what people are discussing. By creating an account you can participate yourself and start your own conversations.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
